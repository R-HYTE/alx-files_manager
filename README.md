# Project Overview

This project summarizes a back-end trimester focused on authentication, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. The objective is to build a platform for uploading and viewing files, implementing various functionalities:

## Functionalities

- **User Authentication via Token**: Secure access to the platform with token-based authentication.
- **List All Files**: Display a list of all uploaded files.
- **Upload a New File**: Add new files to the platform.
- **Change Permission of a File**: Modify access permissions for specific files.
- **View a File**: Access and view files stored on the platform.
- **Generate Thumbnails for Images**: Automatically generate thumbnails for uploaded image files.

## Implementation Guidance

You will be guided step-by-step through the process of building this platform. Feel free to implement additional features, organize code into multiple files, and leverage the `utils` folder for efficient code management.

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience, assembling each component to create a complete product.

Enjoy!
